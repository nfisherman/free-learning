# How to Obtain Textbooks Over the Internet

This guide will teach you how to "legally" obtain textbooks over the internet, even on school wi-fi!

## Setup

First, download and install the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) for your respective operating system. This not only to get faster downloads from the website's servers, but also to ensure that you don't get caught in the process.

> <em>***(optional)*** If you want to be extra sure that you won't get caught while doing this, I would recommend also having a VPN active. Although this is not strictly required, it's always a good idea to have a safety net if for whatever reason Tor fails (which is extremely unlikely). You can use whatever VPN service you want, but a good free option is [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/).</em>

When starting Tor, it'll ask if you want to connect to the Tor network. You're going to want to check "connect automatically", and then wait for the browser to confirm you've connected. You should always wait for the browser to connect to the Tor network before browsing.

Tor ships in the least secure mode, which is great for website compatibility, but not for our purposes.
