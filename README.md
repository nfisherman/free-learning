# How to Obtain Textbooks Over the Internet

This guide will teach you how to "legally" obtain textbooks over the internet, even on school wi-fi!

## Setup

First, download and install the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) for your respective operating system. This not only to get faster downloads from the website's servers, but also to ensure that you don't get caught in the process.

> <em>***(optional)*** If you want to be extra sure that you won't get caught while doing this, I would recommend also having a VPN active. Although this is not strictly required, it's always a good idea to have a safety net if for whatever reason Tor fails (which is extremely unlikely). You can use whatever VPN service you want, but a good free option is [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/).</em>

When starting Tor, it'll ask if you want to connect to the Tor network. You're going to want to check "connect automatically", and then wait for the browser to confirm you've connected. You should always wait for the browser to connect to the Tor network before browsing.

Tor ships in the least secure mode, which is great for website compatibility, but not for our purposes. Click the shield icon in the top right, click the "Settings..." button, and change the security level to "Safest".

> The "Safest" setting breaks compatibility with some websites. This should be fine for our purposes, but if you ever experience any issues with a website, consider turning the security level down to "Safer". You should never change the mode to "Standard".

## Finding Your Book

Navigate to [https://annas-archive.org/](https://annas-archive.org/) in the Tor browser. The search bar allows you to search for a book by various different categories, but specifically in the case of textbooks it's best to search by ISBN, as textbooks often have multiple editions. Most professors should provide the ISBN in the syllabus, but if they don't just Google the book along with it's edition and find a website listing the ISBN. Once you have your ISBN, put it into the searchbar on Anna's Archive and search.

> This website aggregates books from multiple different book websites, so if you can't find it on here, you probably won't have much luck finding it elsewhere.

Click the textbook to pull up its main page.

Scroll down to the section labeled "External Downloads" and click the first link. Click "download from Tor mirror", as it is the fastest option. With any luck, your textbook will begin to download and you're done!

If the first link didn't work, check each subsequent link until you find one that works. If none of the external links work, you should instead try the links under the "Slow downloads" section. Please note that these will require you to turn your security level down to "Safer".
